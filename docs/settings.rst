Settings
========

Values that might change depending on your environment
are kept in ``src/environments``.

The default one is ``src/environments/environment.ts``

..  literalinclude:: ../src/environments/environment.ts
    :lines: 5-

Values used in production mode are kept in ``src/environments/environment.prod.ts``

..  literalinclude:: ../src/environments/environment.prod.ts

To enable production mode, use ``--prod`` when running Angular.
