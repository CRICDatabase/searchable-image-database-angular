If you are new to Angular,
we recommend you to have a look at

- `modules <https://angular.io/guide/architecture-modules>`_,
- `components <https://angular.io/guide/architecture-components>`_,
- `templates <https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax>`_,

In addition to Angular,
we use `Bootstrap <https://getbootstrap.com/>`_ 4.

A few other projects that we are using:

- `FileSaver.js <https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-saver>`_
  to save images in the client,
- `RxJS <https://www.npmjs.com/package/rxjs>`_
  to model/follow the Observable Spec Proposal to the observable,
- `Zone.js <https://www.npmjs.com/package/zone.js>`_
