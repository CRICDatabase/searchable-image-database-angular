                    <b>CRIC Searchable Image Database</b> is a public cervical cell image database aiming supporting cervical cancer analysis of Pap smear. We have collected hundreds of hand labeled segmentation and classification of cervical cells from 4 (four) human specialists (pathologists). The database is a collaborative work among Federal University of Ouro Preto, Federal University of Ceará and University of California-Berkeley.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    We hope CRIC Searchable Image Database will become a useful resource for cervical cancer investigation and may help physicians to provide a healthier life for women worldwide.
