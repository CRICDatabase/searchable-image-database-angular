    <h1>About CRIC Searchable Image Database</h1>

    <p>
        Center for Recognition and Inspection of Cells (CRIC) Searchable Image Database
        is one of the products from a multidisciplinary team of researchers
        from computer science and biology.
    </p>

    <p>
        The database is a collection of real images
        representing a range of different lesions
        in cells interpreted by independent experts.
        The database has information
        about image diagnostic
        and individual cell classification.
