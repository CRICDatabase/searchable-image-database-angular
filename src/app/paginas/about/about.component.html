    <h3>About CRIC</h3>

    <p>
        CRIC Searchable Image Database
        is one of the “products” from a multidisciplinary team of researchers
        from computer science and biology.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Database is a collection of real images
        from human cervix representing a range of different lesions
        in cervical cells interpreted by independent cytopathologists.
        The database will be able to provide information
        about individual cell segmentation, classification or both.
    </p>

    <p>
        The database is also a dynamic environment
        since it has web applications for hand label segmentation
        and classification from specialists.
        The application permits upload images, segment, classify
        and save information, keeping the database in movement.
        Guest area will provide free access to image segmentation example
        and classification database for 400 images.
        Image segmentation database will be available soon.
    </p>
