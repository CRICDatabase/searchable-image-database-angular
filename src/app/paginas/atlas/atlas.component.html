                    The histological architecture of the squamous epithelium of the cervix presents a single layer in the background of rounded basal cells with large, large dark-colored nuclei and sparse cytoplasm, attached to the basement membrane, which separates the epithelium from the underlying stroma. Basal cells divide and mature to form the next layers of cells in the squamous epithelium. So, the other layers they represent only different stages in the maturation of basal cells. Basal cell features nucleus and nucleus / cytoplasmic ratio larger than parabasal cells. They are round or oval, with scarce cytoplasm staining intensely in green or blue. Their cores are round, centrally located, with uniformly distributed chromatin, sometimes with a small nucleolus. These cells desquamate themselves or represent small clusters. In general terms, the basal to superficial layer, these cells undergo an increase in size and a reduction in nuclear size. Basal cells are rarely seen in smears, except in cases of severe atrophy or ulceration of the mucosa. Characterized as a young uterine squamous epithelium cell.

                    This cell type has a round or oval nucleus, slightly smaller than that of the basal cells and contains chromatin granules or cromocenters, the nucleus / cytoplasmic ratio is higher than in intermediate or superficial cells and the cytoplasmic texture is more granular and dense. O cytoplasm is usually basophilic (cyanophilic), with a less intense shade than that seen in the basal cells. They are generally not present in specimens of a hormonally mature epithelium, because they are derived from deep cell layers that are not typically sampled in samples of cervical cytology of pre-menopausal women. The maturation of the squamous epithelium of the cervix depends on estrogen, the female hormone. If there is a lack of estrogen, there is no complete maturation or glycogenation. Therefore, after menopause, cells mature only to the parabasal layer and are not they have multiple layers of flat cells. Thus, in the absence of hormonal stimulation, this cell type comprises layers of a thin, atrophic epithelium. Parabasal cells can predominate in postmenopausal and postpartum. Characterized as young squamous epithelium cell uterine.

                    Usually present in the middle layer of the cervical squamous epithelium. The intermediate cells are the most common cells in smears in the post-ovulatory period of the menstrual cycle, during pregnancy and early menopause. Its predominance is related to the action of progesterone or to adrenocortical hormones. They exhibit generally basophilic, polygonal cytoplasm, with a tendency to folding its edges. The nucleus of the intermediate cell is vesicular, that is, round or oval, with delicate chromatin evenly distributed and visible chromocenters. The abundance of cytoplasm and the smaller nucleus differentiate the intermediate cells from the parabasals. O intermediate cell nucleus serves as a basic size reference for other cells in cervical cytology samples. The cells of the intermediate and superficial layers contain glycogen in your cytoplasm. The glycogenation of the intermediate and superficial layers is a sign of maturation and normal development of the squamous epithelium. Abnormal or altered maturation is characterized by a lack of glycogen production. Characterized as a mature uterine squamous epithelium cell.

                    Derived from the outermost layer of the cervical squamous epithelium and generally seen in the proliferative of the menstrual cycle and in the presence of irritation. They are approximately the same intermediate cells are also polygonal, but the cytoplasm is more flattened and transparent, usually eosinophilic (colored in pink), the nucleus is highly condensed (pycnotic). Keratohyaline granules can be found in the cytoplasm reflecting protein production high molecular weight keratins. The cells of the intermediate and superficial layers contain glycogen in your cytoplasm. The glycogenation of the intermediate and superficial layers is a sign of normal maturation and development of the squamous epithelium. Abnormal or altered maturation is characterized by a lack of glycogen production. Since the complete maturation of the epithelium occurs as a result of the action of estrogens, the predominance of mature squamous cells with pycnotic nucleus represents excellent morphological evidence of estrogenic activity. THE differentiation between a superficial and an intermediate cell is based on the analysis of the structure nuclear. Characterized as a mature uterine squamous epithelium cell.

                    The endocervical canal is covered by the columnar or glandular epithelium. It consists of a single layer tall cells with dark colored nuclei, close to the basement membrane. Because it has a single layer of cells, is less than the stratified squamous epithelium of the cervix. the cells endocervical cells present a relatively abundant, delicate, semitransparent cytoplasm that stains faintly blue, sometimes with vacuoles. The nuclei are round or oval, with some variation in size, finely granular chromatin showing chromocenters or nucleolus. When cells are seen laterally, they take on a columnar shape, with an oval nucleus, located in the basal region, they constitute the arrangements known as “row”, or “palisade”. When the cells are seen from above, they are grouped in mono-stratified sets, lose their columnar shape and sometimes present well-defined cytoplasmic borders, resembling a “honeycomb”. At its distal or upper limit, merges with the endometrial epithelium in the lower part of the uterine body. At the proximal limit or inferior, meets the squamous epithelium at the squamocolumnar junction. Covers a variable extent ectocervix, depending on the woman's age, reproductive, hormonal and menopausal status. O columnar epithelium does not form a flattened surface in the cervical canal, but is pushed inward multiple longitudinal folds that protrude into the canal light, forming papillary projections. Form several invaginations in the cervical stroma matrix, resulting in the formation of endocervical crypts, sometimes called endocervical glands.

                    The physiological replacement of the everted columnar or glandular epithelium with a squamous epithelium newly formed is called squamous metaplasia. The vaginal environment is acidic over the years reproductive and pregnancy. Acidity is believed to play a role in squamous metaplasia. When cells are repeatedly destroyed by vaginal acidity in the columnar epithelium in an area ectropion, over time they are replaced by a newly formed metaplastic epithelium. THE irritation of the columnar epithelium exposed to the acidic vaginal environment leads to the appearance of cells reserve sub-columns. These cells proliferate, producing a hyperplasia of reserve cells and over time they form the metaplastic squamous epithelium. Metaplastic cells are varied, depending on its degree of maturity. Immature metaplastic cells are the size approximate parabasal squamous cells. They can be round, oval, triangular, stellate or caudate, with delicate or dense cytoplasm, possibly with biphasic coloring (ectoplasm / endoplasm) or vacuoles. The nuclei are slightly larger than those of cells intermediate, round or oval, paracentral or central, with finely granular chromatin regularly distributed and sometimes nucleolus. These cells are often available in loose clusters, such as “paving stones”. Mature metaplastic cells resemble original mature squamous cells, but the first ones present slightly denser cytoplasm and more rounded cytoplasmic edges, can also reproduce “paving stones”. THE region of the cervix where squamous metaplasia occurs is called the transformation zone, and the identification of this region is of great importance in colposcopy, since almost all manifestations of cervical carcinogenesis occur in this zone.

                    Smears containing atypias in squamous cells can be classified such as Low – grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), High – grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), cervical invasive cancer (Ca invader). Smears containing atypia in glandular cells can be classified such as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) or invasive adenocarcinoma (cervical, endometrial or other non-specific). <br><br>

                    This atypia occurs in mature cells of the squamous epithelium of the cervix. ASC-US refers to
                    cytological abnormalities that are qualitatively or quantitatively insufficient for a interpretation
                    Low-grade intraepithelial lesion (LSIL). The interpretation of ASC requires that the cells in
                    question demonstrate three essential features: (1) squamous differentiation, (2) increased nuclear
                    to cytoplasmic ratio, and (3) minimal nuclear changes which may include hyperchromasia, chromatin
                    clumping, irregularity, smudging, and/or multinucleation. Nuclei are approximately two and one half
                    to three times the area of the nucleus of a normal intermediate squamous cell (approximately 35 mm
                    2) or twice the size of a squamous metaplastic cell nucleus (approximately 50 μm 2). In other words,
                    there is a slightly increased ratio of the nuclear area to the cytoplasmic área. The clinical course
                    adopted in this case is the repetition of the Pap smear at 3 years for women aged up to 25 years, at
                    1 year for those aged 25-29 years and at 6 months for women over 30 years.

                    Abnormalities in mature cells of the squamous epithelium of the cervix. The criteria used to define
                    this cytological abnormality are: nuclear enlargement more than three times the area of normal
                    intermediate nuclei results in a low but slightly increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio; nuclei are
                    generally hyperchromatic but may be normochromatic; nuclei show variable size (anisonucleosis);
                    chromatin is uniformly distributed and ranges from coarsely granular to smudgy or densely opaque;
                    contour of nuclear membranes is variable ranging from smooth to very irregular with notches;
                    binucleation and multinucleation are common; nucleoli are generally absent or inconspicuous if

                    observed microscopically by means of koilocytosis or perinuclear cavitation consisting of a clear
                    and widely delineated perinuclear zone and a densely-colored peripheral border of cytoplasm is a
                    characteristic. The clinical course adopted in this case is the repetition of the Pap smear in 3
                    years for women up to 25 years and in 6 months for women from 25 years.

                    Atypia affects young cells of the squamous epithelium of the uterine cervix. ASC-H refers to
                    cytological abnormalities that are qualitatively or quantitatively insufficient for a interpretation
                    High–grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). ASC-H is a designation reserved for the minority
                    of ASC cases (expected to represent less than 10 % of all ASC interpretations) in which the
                    cytologic changes are suggestive of HSIL. The interpretation of ASC requires that the cells in
                    question demonstrate three essential features: (1) squamous differentiation, (2) increased nuclear
                    to cytoplasmic ratio, and (3) minimal nuclear changes which may include hyperchromasia, chromatin
                    clumping, irregularity, smudging, and/or multinucleation. The clinical management adopted in this
                    case is the referral for colposcopy and if there is any abnormality in the colon, the biopsy is
                    performed. If no change is observed in the cervix, a new cytology is done in 6 months.

                    Abnormalities in young cells of the squamous epithelium of the cervix. While overall cell size is
                    variable, in general, the cells of HSIL are smaller than those of LSIL. Higher-grade lesions often
                    contain quite small basal-type cells. Nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio is higher in HSIL compared to
                    LSIL. Nuclei are generally hyperchromatic but may be normochromatic or even hypochromatic. Chromatin
                    may be fi ne or coarsely granular and is evenly distributed. Contour of the nuclear membrane is
                    quite irregular and frequently demonstrates prominent indentations or grooves. The clinical
                    management adopted in this case is the referral for colposcopy and if there is any abnormality in
                    the colon, the biopsy is performed. If no change is observed in the cervix, a new cytology is done
                    in 3 months.

                    Lactobacillus vaginalis (Döderlein bacilli) are optional gram-positive bacteria, anaerobic, bacillus-shaped, which are an important component of the vaginal microbial flora physiological. Microorganism enzymes induce proteolytic destruction (cytolysis) of cells intermediary squamous epithelials rich in glycogen. This is metabolized with the production of acid lactic, responsible for the acidic pH of the vagina. There is a predominance of lactobacilli in the luteal phase of menstrual cycle, pregnancy and early menopause.

                    It is a cocobacillus that has the property of adhering to the cytoplasm of superficial and intermediate cells, called target cells or "Clue cell". Gardnerella is often associated with other bacteria, constituting the condition known as bacterial vaginosis. The smear does not contain Döderlein bacilli and there is a shortage of neutrophils.

                    A protozoan characterized as "pear" shaped structures, round or oval. The cytoplasm is usually bluish-gray and may contain red-brown granules. The nucleus is eccentric, semitransparent, slightly basophilic, poorly defined. It is important to visualize the nucleus of the parasite to differentiate it mainly from the remains of cytoplasm, mucus, naked nuclei and degenerated neutrophils. Flagella are sometimes observed. There are significant degenerative cell changes in smears in association with infection by Trichomonas vaginalis, such as perinuclear halos and pseudoeosinophilia, karyrexis and karyolysis. In addition to diffuse purulent exudate, it is common to find accumulations of neutrophils overlapping degenerated epithelial cells known as "cannonballs".

                    Candida is a fungus and considered the most common in infections of the lower genital tract. This microorganism may or may not be associated with symptoms such as itching and thick, whitish vaginal discharge. Candida appears on smears in the form of septate pseudohyphae and round or oval spores. Pseudo-hyphae are often found below clusters of epithelial cells and are more easily visualized when the focus of the microscope is altered, externalizing at the looser end of the cell clusters. It is also convenient to examine the smear margins, since they can exhibit a certain degree of desiccation and consequently result in an artifactual increase, especially of spores, facilitating their identification. In infection by Candida sp. there are usually degenerative cell changes (pseudoeosinophilia, perinuclear halos and retraction of the nuclear border).
